## Don't forget to give a :star: to make the project popular. 

## :boom: What is it all about?
This project contains sample set of test cases for manual testers to help them save time for writing manual test cases. It also has the templates for the Test planning and Bug bash.

## :golf: Why was this project created?
It is always a tedious and boring task to write test cases, which takes most of the time of software testing. Hence, I decided to make generic test cases for the functionality majorly used in software testing so anyone can just download the copy and use it directly in their projects and save their time wasted in writing the generic test cases.


## :bulb: Sample Test Cases and templates are added for the following:
- Generic field level test cases for Textbox, Dropdown-box/Multi-Dropdownbox, Checkbox, Radio button, Submit/Save/Cancel button and Date fields
- Sample Test cases for Export Functionality
- Sample Test cases for Import Functionality
- Sample Test cases for Testing reports
- Sample Test cases for testing Mobile apps
- General Test Cases for Login functionality
- Test Planning Checklist
- Bug bash sheet template

## Recommended Proxies 
There are cases when proxies may be required to run the tests may be manually or using automation. This may happen when the software teams are working in isolation at different places. Another use case is that you need to perform the testing for a website in the region for which access is not available in your current region.

Residential proxies help in keeping the userâ€™s information safe and help in hiding the real location of the user
It acts as a middleman between the device and the internet and keep the users safe from being tracked.
